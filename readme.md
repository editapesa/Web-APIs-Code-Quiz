# Web APIs: Code Quiz

Coding assessments with multiple-choice and/or interactive coding challenges are part of the process in becoming a full-stack developer. This assignment features a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice quetions. I have created and merged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to generate a polished and responsive user interface with the following features.

- Once the "Start" button is clicked, a timer starts and a question is presented.
- After the question is answered, another question is presented.
- If the question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all the questions are answered, or if the timer goes down to zero, the game is over.
- At the end of the game, the user can save their initials and score.
